Object-Oriented Design (OOD) is a programming paradigm centered around
objects that bundle both data and behaviors. Leveraging OOD principles
helps to build modular, maintainable, and scalable systems.

## 7.1 Classes and Interfaces Guidelines

- Keep classes focused (Single Responsibility Principle).
- Prefer composition over deep inheritance trees.

### Example (Python)

```python
class DatabaseClient:
    def __init__(self, connection_pool):
        self._pool = connection_pool

    def fetch(self, sql):
        with self._pool.get() as conn:
            return conn.execute(sql)
```

## 7.2 Encapsulation and Abstraction

- Expose a small, well-documented public API and keep internal helpers
  private.

## 7.3 Design Patterns

- Use patterns (Factory, Strategy, Observer) deliberately — prefer
  simple implementations and document trade-offs.

## 7.4 Reuse and Inheritance Rules

- Favor small, composable objects and clearly documented interfaces.
