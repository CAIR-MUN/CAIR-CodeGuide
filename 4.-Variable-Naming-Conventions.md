Consistent and meaningful variable names are essential for readability,
maintainability, and effective communication in code. This chapter
outlines best practices and conventions for naming variables based on
type, scope, and case style with examples suitable for languages used in
data centers such as Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript.

## 4.1 Guidelines per Data Type or Scope

• Descriptive and specific: Variable names should clearly describe their
purpose or the data they hold. For example, use `userCount` instead of
generic names like `count` or `data`.

• Boolean variables: Start with prefixes like `is`, `has`, `can`, or
`should`, e.g., `isConnected`, `hasAccess`, to imply true/false values
clearly.

• Collections/arrays: Use plural nouns like `userList` or `fileNames` for
arrays or lists.

• Temporary or loop variables: Single-letter names such as `i`, `j`, or
`k` are acceptable in small, localized scopes like loops.

## 4.2 Global, Local, Constants Naming

• Global variables: Should be used sparingly. Use longer, descriptive
names with clear prefixes if needed to avoid conflicts, e.g.,
`globalTimeoutMilliseconds`.

• Local variables: Can be more concise but still meaningful, e.g.,
`tempResult` or `index`.

• Constants: Should be written in uppercase with underscores separating
words (screaming snake case), e.g., `MAX_RETRIES`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`.
This visually distinguishes them from variables that can change.

## 4.3 Meaningful, Readable Names

• Choose whole words over abbreviations unless very common (e.g., `num`
for number is acceptable, but `usr` for user is not recommended).

• Avoid cryptic names that make it hard to understand the variable's
purpose without additional context.

• If a variable represents a specific concept, its name should reflect
it precisely, e.g., `invoiceTotalAmount` instead of `amount`.

## 4.4 Avoid Abbreviations and Unclear Acronyms

• Abbreviations should be avoided unless they are widely understood and
accepted in the domain (e.g., HTTP, URL).

• If abbreviating, be consistent throughout the codebase. Avoid mixing
`num`, `cnt`, and `number` for the same concept.

• Avoid acronyms that are not common knowledge to prevent confusion.

## 4.5 Examples of Good vs. Bad Names

| Bad Name | Reason | Good Name | Explanation |
|---|---|---|---|
| a | Too vague, no meaning | userAge | Clear description of content |
| data | Too generic | fileList | Specific data type or collection |
| isReadyFlag | Redundant suffix | isReady | Boolean indicator without redundancy |
| tmp | Temporary but unclear | tempFilePath | Clarifies purpose and content |
| usrNm | Unclear abbreviation | userName | Clear, full words |

## 4.6 Case Style Rules

| Case Style | Usage | Example | Common Languages |
|---|---|---|---|
| camelCase | Variables, functions | userAge, fetchData | Java, JavaScript, C++ |
| PascalCase | Classes, types | UserAccount, Order | Java, C++, C# |
| snake_case | Variables, functions | user_age, fetch_data | Python, Ruby |
| UPPER_SNAKE_CASE | Constants | MAX_RETRIES, API_KEY | All (common practice) |

## 4.7 Language-specific examples

Python:
```python
# snake_case for variables and functions
user_age = 42
def fetch_data(file_path):
	return open(file_path).read()
# constants
MAX_RETRIES = 5
```

JavaScript:
```javascript
// camelCase for variables and functions
let userAge = 42;
function fetchData(filePath) {
  return fetch(filePath);
}
// constants (often UPPER_SNAKE_CASE)
const MAX_RETRIES = 5;
```

Java:
```java
// camelCase for variables and methods, PascalCase for classes
public class UserAccount {
	private int userAge;
	public int getUserAge() { return userAge; }
	public static final int MAX_RETRIES = 5;
}
```

C++:
```cpp
// camelCase or snake_case depends on project; classes often PascalCase
class UserAccount {
public:
	int userAge;
	static constexpr int MAX_RETRIES = 5;
};
```

Consistently applying these naming conventions ensures code is easier to
read, maintain, and collaborate on, reducing cognitive barriers for all
team members.
