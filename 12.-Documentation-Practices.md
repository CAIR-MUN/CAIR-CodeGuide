Good documentation keeps knowledge fresh and reduces onboarding time.
This chapter outlines practical rules for code comments, API docs, and
automated doc generation.

## 12.1 Comment Guidelines

- Explain why, not what. Code should be readable; comments add
  intent and rationale.
- Keep comments brief and up-to-date with code changes.
- Avoid redundant comments that restate obvious code.

## 12.2 Docstrings and API Documentation

- Use language-appropriate docstring formats (Google, NumPy, or
  reStructuredText for Python; Javadoc for Java).
- Document function purpose, parameters, return values, raised
  exceptions, and side effects.

Example (Python Google-style):

```python
def fetch_user(user_id: int) -> dict:
    """Fetch user data by id.

    Args:
        user_id: numeric id of the user.

    Returns:
        A dict containing user fields.

    Raises:
        UserNotFoundError: if the user does not exist.
    """
    pass
```

## 12.3 Auto-generated Documentation

- Use Sphinx (Python), Javadoc (Java), or Doxygen (C/C++) to generate
  API docs.
- Integrate doc generation into CI so docs stay current alongside
  releases.

## 12.4 Documentation for Developers and Users

- Keep a developer README explaining how to build, test, and run the
  project.
- Provide usage examples and quick-start guides for common workflows.
- Maintain a changelog or release notes for notable changes.

## 12.5 Keeping Docs in Sync

- Treat documentation updates as part of code changes and include them
  in pull requests.
- Use templates and checklists for new modules to ensure minimal
  documentation is provided.

## 12.6 Tools and Links

- Sphinx (Python), MkDocs, Jekyll for static site docs.
- Swagger/OpenAPI for API contract documentation.
- Keep doc generation scripts and config files in the repo.
