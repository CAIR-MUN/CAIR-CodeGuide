Code reviews are a key quality gate — they find bugs, spread knowledge,
and ensure conformance to standards.

## Purpose and Process

- Use pull requests for all non-trivial changes and require at least one
  reviewer.
- Include a clear description of the problem, the change, and any
  testing performed.
- Keep pull requests small and focused to make reviews effective.

## What to Look For

- **Correctness**: does the change do what it intends, with edge cases
  considered?
- **Readability**: is the code clear and maintainable?
- **Security**: are inputs validated and secrets protected?
- **Performance**: are there obvious inefficiencies introduced?
- **Tests**: are there meaningful tests and do they pass?

## Feedback Best Practices

- Be specific and constructive; point to lines and suggest fixes.
- Focus on the code, not the author; prefer questions over statements.
- When disagreeing, provide examples or reference standards.

## Review Workflow Recommendations

- Assign an owner for the change and a reviewer for accountability.
- Use automated checks (linters, unit tests, security scanners) to
  catch mechanical issues before a human review.
- Address smaller comments with fixes and push updates as follow-up
  commits.

## Handling Conflicts

- If disputes arise, escalate to a tech lead or use the project's
  decision process.
- Document the chosen path and reasoning for future reference.
